### Git Flow
- Pull latest master commits
- fork a new branch. Name it lik tb-{{tiket_num}} like **td-1**, **td-77** etc.
- Write code
- Commit code with message starts with tiket name like **git commit -m "TD-1 Added .gitignore and requirements.txt files**
- Push Them to origin, and create PR to master branch
- After fixing possible remarks from other contributors, accept PR.

P.S Note that there should be just one commit which should be merged to master. You can use **--amend** commiting new code to your branch, or squash them after review is done, both ways are ok.
